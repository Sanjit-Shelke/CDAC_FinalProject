# CDAC_FinalProject

"Agro Bidding System" is a web application in which farmers will be able to show case there agri products on website and buyers can do a bid on particular products. 
 The main objective of this project is to obtain best value and the highest price for the farmers agri products.

We have created a website where buyer can participate in auction for any agri product and in this auction type, many sellers offer their items and compete for the bidding. In this auction the buyer can accept any bid, by paying for every bid he can buy or can reject all the items.
In First sealed price auction, the bidder can bid and one who bids for highest price will get that agri product and farmer will also get good price for their products.
Thus, here a new method is tried to find a solution to make the farmers to sell their agri products. A bidding website with all the other kinds of features such as a chat forum would satisfy the farmer needs.
